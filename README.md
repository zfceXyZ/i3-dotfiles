# i3-dotfiles
My i3 dotfiles

All complete with polybar config, and some keybindings

Used programs

* i3 (obviously)
* 
* polybar

* picom

* st

# OPTIONAL keybound programs

* neovim

* lf

* thunar

* gotop

* firefox

My st configuration is ABSOLUTELY not mine but its luke smith's fork, which i cant recommend enough, check it out at https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/st

# Keybindings

Mod+w - opens firefox

Mod+p - opens gotop

mod+Shift+p - opens up neovim

mod+e - opens up thunar

mod+Shift+e - opens up lf

mod+q - kills focused windows

mod+Shift+q - quits i3

mod+i - enables tabbed windows

mod+o - goes back to normal tiling

mod+d - opens rofi

mod+Shift+d - opens up dmenu

moving windows is changed to vim bindings

Tip: If a keybinding wasn't mentioned, its probably because it wasn't changed or i forgot, in any case feel free to look further into the config

# Added shiny cool stuff

* rounded corners
* transparent terminals
* Polybar, not too changed but still very neat at its state (systray module doesn't work, idk much about polybar)
* Intuitive keybindings
* Pretty standard i3 experience with some added *pazzaz*
